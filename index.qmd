We chose the Boston 311 Service Requests topic because it offers a unique window into how a city addresses everyday challenges faced by its residents. From potholes to noise complaints, this data captures the pulse of Bostonâ€™s public services and the issues that matter most to its communities. By analyzing Boston 311 Service Requests dataset, we aim to uncover patterns in the types of service requests, their geographical distribution, and how efficiently they are resolved.

Exploring this data not only highlights the responsiveness of urban governance but also sheds light on potential areas for improvement in delivering public services effectively.
