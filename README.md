# Boston 311 Service Requests

This repository contains the final project for the "Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization" course. The project focuses on analyzing Boston's 311 Service Requests to gain insights into the city's approach to addressing non-emergency issues reported by its residents. By exploring patterns in the types of requests, their geographic distribution, and the timeliness of responses, the analysis aims to shed light on the effectiveness of public service delivery in Boston. 

The project includes data preprocessing, detailed exploratory data analysis, interactive visualizations, and thoughtful commentary on the findings. By diving into this data, we hope to highlight areas where services excel and identify opportunities for improvement to better meet the needs of Boston's diverse neighborhoods.
