    "text": "1 Introduction\nTopic: Boston 311 Service Requests\nWe chose the Boston 311 Service Requests topic because it offers a unique window into how a city addresses everyday challenges faced by its residents. From potholes to noise complaints, this data captures the pulse of Boston’s public services and the issues that matter most to its communities. By analyzing Boston 311 Service Requests dataset, we aim to uncover patterns in the types of service requests, their geographical distribution, and how efficiently they are resolved. For readers unfamiliar with 311 systems, they serve as a vital link between residents and city departments, enabling people to report non-emergency issues and request services. Exploring this data not only highlights the responsiveness of urban governance but also sheds light on potential areas for improvement in delivering public services effectively. To start, we are interested in identifying patterns related to the volume of requests, the reasons behind them, the neighborhoods they pertain to, and the departments responsible for addressing them.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nFor this project, we are using the latest Boston 311 Service Requests dataset of year 2024, which is publicly available on the Boston.gov open data portal. This dataset is maintained by the City of Boston and contains detailed records of non-emergency service requests submitted by residents through the city’s 311 system. The data includes fields such as request types, submission dates, locations, statuses, and resolution times, offering a comprehensive view of the city’s service management. The dataset is updated regularly, ensuring it reflects current trends, although the exact frequency of updates is not explicitly specified. It is provided in a tabular format, accessible as a CSV file, and includes both categorical and geographic data, such as latitude, longitude, and neighborhood identifiers. One potential challenge is the presence of missing or inconsistent data, particularly in fields like “closure reason” or “submitted photo,” which will require preprocessing. We plan to import the dataset into RStudio using the read.csv function for cleaning and analysis. The dataset can be accessed from its original source at Boston 311 Service Requests with the year 2024. There are 274,415 total rows and 30 columns in this dataset.",

Moreover, considering that these columns just contain links to photographs taken at the scene of the 311 request, these columns will not very important to our analysis.\nAdditionally, columns such as “closure_reason”, “closed_dt”, “location_zipcode”, and “sla_target_dt” are around 20% null values. This would only potentially impact analysis related to request response times, as we have other columns such as “location” and “latitude”/“longitude” to help us understand geographical trends, and columns such as “type”, “reason”, and “subject” to help us with request categorization.\nAll of the other columns either have 0 null values, or a very small percentage (&lt; 1.5%) of null values, indicating that the dataset is generally complete and reliable for most analyses.\n\n\nCode\n# https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/naniar/vignettes/naniar-visualisation.html\n# install.packages(\"naniar\")\nlibrary(naniar)\n\nnaniar::vis_miss(df,warn_large_data = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Missing Data Heatmap\",\n    subtitle = \"Visual Representation of Missing Values in a Subset of df\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot provides a more detailed visualiation of the amount ane location of missing data, and also providing information on the overall percentage of missing values overall in the legend.\nSpecifically, we can infer that missingness is not exactly uniform, meaning that there may be clusters of rows with higher concentrations of missing data. For example, in the “closed_photo” column of the plot, we can identify a few clusters where there is more/less missing data. We also get a proportion on the total amount of missing values in our dataset–8.6%, indicating that while the overall proportion of missing data is relatively low.",

The most common reason is “Enforcement & Abandoned Vehicles,” accounting for over 60,000 requests (22.5% of the total), followed by “Street Cleaning” and “Code Enforcement.”\nThis naturally leads to the question: what do these reasons actually represent? Specifically, can we uncover more details about what these requests entail? By consulting the attached data dictionary, we learn that the “reason” and “type” columns are part of a hierarchical case classification system, where “reason” represents a broader category, and “type” provides a more detailed breakdown (REASON &gt; TYPE).\nThis allows us to create the following alluvial diagram, showing how a “reason” flows to different “types”.\n\n\nCode\ntop_5_reasons &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  count(reason, sort = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  slice_max(n = 5, order_by = n) %&gt;%\n  pull(reason)\n\ndf_top5 &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  filter(reason %in% top_5_reasons)\n\ntop_10_types &lt;- df_top5 %&gt;%\n  count(type, sort = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  slice_max(n = 10, order_by = n) %&gt;%\n  pull(type)\n\ndf_aggregated &lt;- df_top5 %&gt;%\n  mutate(type = ifelse(type %in% top_10_types, type, \"Other\"))\n\nreason_type_counts &lt;- df_aggregated %&gt;%\n  count(reason, type)\n\n# Then plot as before\nggplot(reason_type_counts,\n       aes(axis1 = reason, axis2 = type, y = n)) +\n  geom_alluvium(aes(fill = reason), width = 1/12, alpha = 0.8) +\n  geom_stratum(width = 1/12, fill = \"grey80\", color = \"grey50\") +\n  geom_text(stat = \"stratum\", aes(label = after_stat(stratum)), size = 3, hjust = 0) +\n  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(\"Reason\", \"Type\"), expand = c(.1, .1)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n        panel.grid = element_blank(),\n        axis.title = element_blank()) +\n  coord_cartesian(clip = \"off\") +\n  theme(plot.margin = unit(c(0, 4.85, 0, 0), \"cm\"))+\n  labs(\n    title = \"Alluvial Diagram of Top 5 Reasons with Aggregated Types\",\n    fill = \"Reason\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that since the “type” column contains too many categories and makes the alluvial chart unreadable, we aggregated less frequent categories into an “Other” category. Specifically, this alluvial diagram only shows the top 10 most frequent types, drawn from the subsetted dataframe of top 5 reasons.\nThe main thing to notice is that the vast majority of “Enforcement & Abandoned Vehicles” requests are for Parking Enforcement (57,299 requests), making this the most common source for 311 requests in our dataset. Boston, similar to New York City, is a dense urban environment, where limited parking availability and strict enforcement policies often lead to conflicts and violations.\n“Code Enforcement” is another significant category, with the most frequent type being “Improper Storage of Trash (Barrels)” (18,782 requests), followed by “Poor Conditions of Property” (8,116 requests). The high volume of trash-related requests may stem from challenges in managing waste in densely populated areas or neighborhoods with limited access to proper waste disposal resources. We will investigate geographic trends soon.\n“Street Cleaning” requests are predominantly related to “Requests for Street Cleaning” (20,681 requests), with “CE Collection” (16,506 requests) also being a major contributor. Smaller, specialized issues like “Pick up Dead Animal” (7,854 requests) are also noteworthy.\n“Highway Maintenance” primarily involves “Request for Pothole Repair” (10,158 requests), indicating the persistent issue of potholes in the city’s infrastructure. The “Other” type here accounts for 11,083 requests, suggesting a wide range of miscellaneous highway-related issues.\n“Sanitation” requests are dominated by “Schedule a Bulk Item Pickup” (11,162 requests) and its closely related subtype “Schedule a Bulk Item Pickup SS” (6,918 requests). These reflect residents’ need for efficient disposal of larger waste items.\nNow that we have an idea of both the temporal trends of requests and the request reasons, let’s see the temporal trends of request reasons!\n\n\nCode\nselected_reasons &lt;- c(\n                      # \"Enforcement & Abandoned Vehicles\",\n                      \"Signs & Signals\",\n                      \"Highway Maintenance\",\n                      \"Sanitation\",\n                      \"Street Cleaning\",\n                      \"Graffiti\",\n                      \"Park Maintenance & Safety\")\n\n# only the selected reasons\ndf_filtered &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  filter(reason %in% selected_reasons)\n\ndf_monthly &lt;- df_filtered %&gt;%\n  mutate(month = floor_date(open_dt, \"month\")) %&gt;%\n  group_by(reason, month) %&gt;%\n  summarize(request_count = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\ndf_monthly$month = as.Date(df_monthly$month, format = \"%Y-%m-%d\") \n\n# LINE CHART\nggplot(df_monthly, aes(x = month, y = request_count, color = reason)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"1 month\", date_labels = \"%b %Y\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Monthly Request Counts by Reason\",\n    x = \"Month\",\n    y = \"Number of Requests\",\n    color = \"Reason\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        legend.position=\"bottom\",\n        legend.box = \"horizontal\",\n        legend.title = element_blank(),\n\n)+\nguides(\n    color = guide_legend(\n      nrow = 2,                   # Force legend into 2 rs\n      byrow = TRUE,\n      # title.position = \"top\",   \n      title.hjust = 0.5\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe handpicked six reasons of interest and plotted them. Notably, Street Cleaning requests demonstrate a consistent upward trajectory throughout the year, culminating in a significant peak in August. Similar to before, this surge likely correlates with increased outdoor activities and public presence during the summer months, which naturally result in more debris and litter accumulation.\nSimilarly, both Sanitation and Park Maintenance & Safety categories exhibit pronounced peaks during the summer. The warmer weather encourages greater utilization of parks and recreational areas, leading to increased waste generation and a corresponding rise in maintenance and safety concerns.\nHighway Maintenance requests, on the other hand, peak in the spring. This trend is likely a result of post-winter recovery efforts, where roads suffer damage from ice, snow removal activities, and the freeze-thaw cycles common in colder climates. These conditions lead to the formation of potholes, cracks, and other roadway imperfections that require timely repairs to ensure safe and efficient transportation.\nIn contrast, the Graffiti and Signs & Signals categories maintain relatively stable request volumes throughout the year. Switching gears a bit, let’s explore how long each request takes to be resolved.",

This new column represents the time each request took from its opening to its official closure. Plotting a histogram of these raw duration values revealed a highly right-skewed distribution. This skewness indicates that while most requests were closed relatively quickly, a significant number took much longer to resolve, making for an unclear visualization.\nTo address the skewness and normalize the distribution, we applied a log-transform to the column. It’s important to note that although the data has been log-transformed to achieve a more symmetric distribution, the x-axis of the histogram is still labeled in the original time units (hours). This means that while the shape of the distribution reflects the log-transformed values, the axis maintains interpretability in terms of actual request durations.\nThe transformed distribution exhibits a tri-modal pattern, with distinct peaks at approximately 0.5 hours, 15 hours, and 100 hours.

Additionally, Sanitation and Highway Maintenance appear in this category, indicating that infrastructure-related requests require more coordination across different sectors and resources, leading to longer resolution times.\nIn the over 24 hours category, Enforcement & Abandoned Vehicles remains the most prevalent reason, underscoring that some enforcement actions are more complex and time-consuming, possibly involving legal processes or logistical challenges.\nLet’s switch gears a bit, and explore where, on a map, these requests are actually made to.",

Roxbury, South Boston, and Jamaica Plain follow with substantial request counts, each registering over 20,000. Meanwhile, more central neighborhoods such as the South End, East Boston, and Jamaica Plain also record considerable activity, reflecting ongoing demands for city services and infrastructure support. Although areas like Back Bay and Downtown/Financial District report fewer requests relative to the top performers, their numbers still exceed 10,000, indicating that no part of the city is without frequent resident needs.\nThis raises an important question: does the volume of requests in a neighborhood correlate with how quickly they are resolved? Exploring the relationship between neighborhood request density and resolution times can provide valuable insights into the city’s resource allocation and service efficiency.\n\n\nCode\ndf |&gt; \n  group_by(neighborhood) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    avg_duration = mean(duration_hours, na.rm = TRUE), \n    request_count = n()\n  ) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = request_count, y = avg_duration, label = neighborhood)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\", size = 3) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    size = 3, \n    box.padding = 0.35,     # Space around the text label\n    point.padding = 0.5,    # Space between the point and the label\n    segment.color = 'grey50', # Color of the line connecting label to point\n    max.overlaps = Inf       # Allow all labels to be displayed without removing any\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Request Volume vs. Resolution Time by Neighborhood\",\n    x = \"Number of Requests\",\n    y = \"Average Resolution Time (Hours)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, the data indicates that the average resolution time remains relatively consistent irrespective of the number of requests a neighborhood receives. Most neighborhoods exhibit average resolution times within the 100 to 200-hour range, suggesting a standardized efficiency in handling service requests city-wide.\nHowever, the graph identifies some outliers that deviate from this general trend. Notably, West Roxbury and Roslindale, neighboring areas located in the southwestern corner of Boston, exhibit higher-than-average resolution times. This clustering of high-resolution times in adjacent areas may be attributed to several factors, such as limited access to city resources, higher volumes of complex requests, or logistical challenges inherent to their geographic locations.\nConversely, Dorchester stands out by receiving the highest number of requests while maintaining an average resolution time within the expected range. This balance between high request volume and consistent resolution times highlights effective resource management and operational efficiency within the neighborhood. Dorchester’s ability to handle a large influx of requests without compromising on resolution speed reflects positively on the city’s capacity to support densely populated or highly active areas without overburdening service departments\nLastly, neighborhoods such as the South End and South Boston/South Boston Waterfront, located adjacent to the popular Seaport District, as well as Back Bay, located near bustling shopping areas, demonstrate remarkably low average resolution times. These neighborhoods are located in the heart of Boston and are surrounded by dense urban environments, bustling streets, and commercial establishments that may be better equipped to handle service demands efficiently. For example, the central location probably facilitates quicker access to city services and resources, while the concentration of businesses and amenities may streamline the process of addressing and resolving requests.\n\n\nCode\nselected_neighborhoods &lt;- c(\"Roslindale\", \"West Roxbury\", \"Back Bay\", \"South Boston / South Boston Waterfront\", \"South End\", \"Dorchester\")\n\n\ndf_filtered &lt;- df |&gt; \n  filter(neighborhood %in% selected_neighborhoods) |&gt; \n  group_by(neighborhood) |&gt; \n  count(reason, name = \"count\") |&gt; \n  slice_max(order_by = count, n = 3, with_ties = FALSE) |&gt; \n  ungroup()\n\n\nggplot(df_filtered, aes(x = fct_reorder(neighborhood, count, .desc = TRUE), y = count, fill = reason)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = position_dodge(width = 0.9), width = 0.9) +  # Grouped bar settings\n  labs(\n    title = \"Top 3 Reasons for 311 Requests by Neighborhood\",\n    x = \"Neighborhood\",\n    y = \"Count of Requests\",\n    fill = \"Reason\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 7, angle = 45, hjust = 1),  # Rotate x-axis labels for clarity\n    plot.margin = margin(10, 1, 10, 10),  # Optional: Adjust margins\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()   # Optional: Remove grid lines for better readability\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreaking down the six neighborhoods from the previous graph by reasons highlights both similarities and differences in 311 request patterns.\nSouth Boston / South Boston Waterfront stands out with an overwhelming number of requests for Enforcement & Abandoned Vehicles, likely driven by the notorious parking challenges in the Seaport area, where residents and visitors frequently report parking violations.\nIn contrast, bustling downtown neighborhoods like the South End, Seaport, and Back Bay share the same top three reasons for 311 requests: Code Enforcement, Enforcement & Abandoned Vehicles, and Street Cleaning. These categories reflect the unique demands of urban areas with dense populations and high activity levels.\nMeanwhile, less urban neighborhoods such as Roslindale, West Roxbury, and Dorchester show a different pattern. While Enforcement & Abandoned Vehicles remains a top concern, other requests like Sanitation and Tree Maintenance also feature prominently, reflecting the more residential and suburban characteristics of these areas.",

Nonetheless, the data shows a steady increase in the number of requests throughout 2024, peaking in August before declining. Perhaps this trend can be attributed to the warm weather. Warmer months, especially in summer, often bring increased outdoor activities such as public events, festivals, and tourism. These activities lead to a rise in noise complaints, trash collection requests, and reports of public infrastructure issues, explaining the upward trend in 311 requests as the weather gets warmer.\nWhile exploring seasonal trends provide us with insights into how external factors like weather and activities influence the volume of requests, we can also analyze patterns by day of the week and hour of the day to get a closer look at when residents are most likely to engage with the 311 system. These finer temporal trends can help us understand the daily rhythms of service requests and how they align with the city’s operational dynamics.\n\n\nCode\ndf$day_of_week &lt;- wday(df$open_dt, label = TRUE, week_start = 1) # Monday = 1\ndf$hour &lt;- hour(df$open_dt)\n\ndf$day_of_week &lt;- factor(df$day_of_week, levels = c(\"Sun\", \"Mon\", \"Tue\", \"Wed\", \"Thu\", \"Fri\", \"Sat\"))\ndf$day_of_week &lt;- fct_rev(df$day_of_week)\n\nheat_data &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  count(day_of_week, hour)\n\nggplot(heat_data, aes(x = hour, y = day_of_week, fill = n)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c() +\n  labs(title = \"Requests by Day of Week and Hour of Day\",\n       x = \"Hour of Day\", y = \"Day of Week\", fill = \"Count\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe requests appear to be more concentrated during early mornings of weekdays, suggesting that most issues reported are likely related to workweek activities, such as commuting, public services, or business-related issues. The lower activity on weekends might reflect reduced reporting due to fewer operational hours of city departments or residents being less engaged with city services during days off. The gradual decline in requests after the morning hours suggests that residents are less likely to report issues as the day progresses, possibly due to being occupied with work or other activities.\nUnderstanding when residents engage with the 311 system provides valuable insight into the timing of service needs. However, to gain a deeper understanding of the issues themselves, we can analyze the reasons behind these requests.",
